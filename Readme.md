# Speach AI

React web application that converts speech to speech using OpenAI services. The app captures audio from the browser, transcribes what the user said, and returns a spoken response generated by an AI assistant.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- A valid OpenAI key stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run the development servers (client + API) with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173` and an Express server at `http://localhost:5000`. Thanks to the configured proxy, the client forwards `/api` requests to the backend.

## Production

1. Build the React application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the Express server that serves the compiled files and exposes the `/api/speech` endpoint:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser and grant microphone permissions.
2. Press **Start speaking** to record your question.
3. Stop the recording to send the audio to the backend.
4. The assistant transcribes your voice, generates a response, and plays it automatically.

If you want to target a backend deployed at another URL, define `VITE_API_URL` in a `.env` file at the project root.
